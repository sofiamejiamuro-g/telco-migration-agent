## 3. BigQuery SQL Authoring Guidelines for Configurable Dashboards

1. **Partition Pruning**: Always filter by `conversation_start_time` (or use the dashboard-level date range filter) to optimize BigQuery scan cost and dashboard latency.
2. **Safe Division**: Use `SAFE_DIVIDE(numerator, denominator)` instead of standard `/` to prevent divide-by-zero runtime exceptions.
3. **Null Handling**: Wrap string and category fields in `COALESCE(field, 'UNKNOWN')` to avoid orphaned Vega-Lite legend keys.
4. **Column Naming**: Name SQL projection columns matching the `field` encodings defined in the Vega-Lite `chart_spec` (e.g. `total_conversations`, `call_date`, `avg_qa_score`).
