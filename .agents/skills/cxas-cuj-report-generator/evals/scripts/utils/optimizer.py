Current SKILL.md:
{current_skill}

Failed cases and rationales:
{failure_log}

Analyze why the agent failed to satisfy expectations, and rewrite `SKILL.md` adding highly specific, concrete rules to prevent these failures in the future. Preserve all unrelated rules.
Specifically, enforce these critical rules:
1. The `tool_call` (such as `end_session`) and `webhook_call` fields MUST be written at the root level of individual turn objects in the YAML transcript, and MUST NOT be nested under `enrichment` or any other parent key.

Output the complete, optimized SKILL.md content directly in your response. Do not include any markdown wrappers or conversational explanations, just the exact new optimized SKILL.md content."""
