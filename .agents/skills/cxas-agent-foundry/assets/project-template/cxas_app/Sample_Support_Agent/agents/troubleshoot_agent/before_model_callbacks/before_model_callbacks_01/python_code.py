before_model_callback — Sub-Agent (Troubleshooting)

PURPOSE:
    Same trigger pattern as the root agent's before_model_callback.

WHY THIS EXISTS (THE CALLBACK GAP PROBLEM):
    In multi-agent architectures, when a user's message is handled by a sub-agent,
    the ROOT agent's callbacks DO NOT FIRE. This means:

    1. Customer is talking to the Troubleshooting sub-agent
    2. Customer says "I want to speak to a human"
    3. The sub-agent's instruction tells the LLM to set _action_trigger = "escalate"
    4. On the next model call, the trigger needs to be intercepted

    If only the root agent has a before_model_callback, the trigger is NEVER
    intercepted because the sub-agent is handling the conversation. The LLM
    then improvises — calling tools with wrong args, forgetting to call them,
    or transferring to the wrong agent.

FIX:
    Add the trigger-handling before_model_callback to ALL agents that handle
    user messages. The logic can be identical or adapted to the sub-agent's
    specific needs.

    In production, consider extracting the shared trigger logic into a common
    module and importing it in each agent's callback. For this template, we
    duplicate it for clarity.

PLATFORM GLOBALS (do NOT import these):
    CallbackContext, Content, Part, LlmResponse, LlmRequest are auto-provided
    by the GECX sandbox at runtime. The 'tools' global is also auto-provided
    for calling tools from callbacks. Only standard library imports (typing,
    re, etc.) need explicit import statements.
