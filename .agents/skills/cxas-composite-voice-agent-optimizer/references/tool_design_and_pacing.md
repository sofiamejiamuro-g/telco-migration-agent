# Tool Design & Conversational Pacing

This reference defines tool docstring contracts, conversational pacing directives, payload contamination prevention, and execution standards for the dialogue reasoning model in the Gemini Composite V1 architecture.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Tool Docstring Engineering

In Gemini Composite V1, tool docstrings serve as explicit prompt instructions for the reasoning model. Because the model operates at low thinking effort to minimize conversational latency, docstrings must provide unambiguous execution contracts for all tools that are visible to the model. Only tools configured in the `agent_name.json` will be visible to the model. And as such will be provided in the prompt to the model.

### Source of Truth & Preservation Rules for Tool Docstrings:
- **Preserve Existing Documentation:** Never wipe or replace existing function descriptions, parameter explanations, or return signatures. Additive enhancement only.
- **Python Tools (`tools/<name>/python_function/python_code.py`):** The Python function docstring inside `python_code.py` is the **exclusive canonical source of truth** in CXAS/CES. Always audit and update docstrings directly in the Python source code rather than mutating the `.json` configuration file.
- **Non-Python Tools:** The tool description in `<name>.json` (`openApiTool.description` or `clientFunction.description`) is the source of truth.

### Mandatory Tool Docstring Sections:

1.  **Summary & Capabilities**: Clear description of what the tool executes.
2.  **Execution Guidelines (When to Call & When NOT to Call)**: Explicit operational boundaries to prevent ungrounded or hallucinated tool invocations.
3.  **Conversational Pacing Directive (for Latency-Sensitive Tools)**: Prompt instructing the model to speak a brief spoken phrase before tool execution.
4.  **Parameter Specifications**: Types, valid values, and default behaviors.
5.  **Context Argument Synthesis Rules**: How to rewrite brief caller fragments into complete semantic statements.

### Example in `tools/manage_service_appointment/python_function/python_code.py`:

```python
def manage_service_appointment(
    action_code: str,
    date_requested: str,
    slot_id: str | None = None,
    user_intent_summary: str | None = None,
) -> dict[str, Any]:
  """Checks availability, schedules, and modifies service appointments.

  Handles actions:
  - 'CHECK_SLOTS': Retrieves available time windows for the requested date.
  - 'BOOK_SLOT': Confirms and reserves a selected appointment window upon user consent.
  - 'CANCEL_SLOT': Cancels an existing reserved appointment.

  When NOT to call:
  - Do NOT call when the user is asking general informational questions about service types.
  - Do NOT call 'BOOK_SLOT' before the user explicitly selects and confirms a specific time window.

  Before calling this tool, speak a brief, natural conversational pacing phrase with varied options to avoid repetitive responses (e.g., 'Let me check the available time slots for you...', 'Just a minute, let me look it up...', or 'Reserving that time window now.').

  Args:
    action_code: Action to perform ('CHECK_SLOTS', 'BOOK_SLOT', 'CANCEL_SLOT').
    date_requested: Target appointment date (YYYY-MM-DD).
    slot_id: Selected time slot identifier (required for 'BOOK_SLOT').
    user_intent_summary: Full synthesized summary of the user's explicit request.

  Returns:
    Dict containing execution status and appointment details.
  """
  ...
```

## 2. Spoken Conversational Pacing Phrases & Priority Classification

In a composite voice architecture, tool execution introduces processing delay before the model generates the tool result and streams text to the TTS engine. Without a pacing phrase, the caller experiences dead air.

### Priority Tiering & Human Approval Policy:
- **Priority P2 (Lowest Priority - Spoken Conversational Pacing):** Conversational pacing directives (`MISSING_TOOL_CONVERSATIONAL_PACING` / `T014`) are audited at **Priority P2 (Lowest Priority / Advisory)**. Spoken conversational pacing must **ONLY be added for tools explicitly approved by the person executing the skill**. Never automatically or bulk-inject pacing phrases across tools without explicit user confirmation.
- **Priority P2 (Tool Operational Docstrings):** Missing fundamental docstring contracts (`When to Call:`, `When NOT to Call:`) or parameter specifications on active runtime execution paths represent Priority P1 findings.

### Pacing Rules:
- **Explicit Approval Required**: Conversational pacing is only added to latency-heavy or backend API tools specifically selected and approved by the developer / user executing the skill.
- **Pacing Directive with Multiple Phrasing Options**: When approved, active tool docstrings should explicitly direct the model to emit a brief, natural conversational bridge phrase with varied phrasing options *before* invoking the function call (e.g., *"Let me check that for you..."*, *"Just a minute, let me look it up..."*, *"Looking into the schedule for that day..."*) to prevent repetitive responses across turns. Terminal / fast lifecycle tools (e.g. session wrap-up, exit, test mocks) are exempt from `MISSING_TOOL_CONVERSATIONAL_PACING` checks.
- **No Premature Claims**: The model must never predict the tool outcome or quote result values in the pacing phrase before the tool has returned its payload.

### 2.1 Cross-Scope Contradictions & Anti-Looping Prevention (P0 Critical):
A critical failure mode occurs when agent instructions and tool docstrings impose mutually contradictory constraints on spoken dialogue.

#### Conflicting Instructions Example:
- **Agent Instruction (`agents/appointments/instruction.txt`):**
  ```
  Always call the `manage_service_appointment` tool, wait for its response and then generate a response. Never say anything which is not in the tool response.
  ```
- **Tool Docstring (`tools/manage_service_appointment/...`):**
  ```
  Before calling this tool, speak a brief, natural conversational pacing phrase with varied options to avoid repetitive responses (e.g., 'Let me check the available time slots for you...', 'Just a minute, let me look it up...', or 'Reserving that time window now.').
  ```

#### Why This Breaks the Agent:
The agent instruction forbids speaking before receiving the tool response (*"wait for its response and then generate a response"* / *"Never say anything which is not in the tool response"*), whereas the tool docstring mandates speaking a pacing phrase *before* invoking the tool. This direct contradiction creates an impossible operational constraint for Gemini Composite V1, resulting in:
1. **Model Looping & Hesitation:** The model repeatedly tries and aborts generating tool calls and conversational turns.
2. **Dead Air / Latency Spikes:** The agent stalls or times out waiting for conflicting internal policies to resolve.
3. **Safety Fallbacks:** Triggers generic platform fallback messages (*"I'm sorry, I'm having trouble with that right now."*).

#### Collaborative Remediation Strategy:
This is a **Priority P0 blocker**. The skill must detect this contradiction, present it to the user, and ask clarifying questions to align the behaviors:
- **Harmonized Agent Instruction (Recommended):** Update the agent instruction to explicitly permit spoken pacing phrases before tool execution while keeping the final answer grounded in the tool response:
  ```
  Before invoking `manage_service_appointment`, speak a natural conversational pacing phrase. Once the tool responds, generate your answer grounded strictly in the tool output. Never invent details not returned by the tool.
  ```
- **Docstring Adjustment (Alternative):** If the agent must remain completely silent prior to tool return, remove the pre-call pacing requirement from the tool docstring.

## 3. Foreign Tool Payload Contamination Protection

Backend databases, knowledge bases, and API integrations frequently return raw JSON payloads, English error strings, or system identifiers (e.g., `{"status": "Out of stock", "category": "Equipment"}`).

### Vulnerability:

Without explicit boundary instructions, LLMs often quote or parrot raw tool output strings verbatim into non-English or specialized sessions, causing sudden language flips or broken persona tone.

### Mitigation:

Instruct the agent to formulate search queries in the API's required format, but synthesize all spoken customer responses strictly in the session language (`{{user_language}}`):

```xml
<taskflow>
    <step name="ExecuteLookup">
        <action>
            1. Formulate search parameters in the backend's expected query format.
            2. Invoke {@TOOL: lookup_tool} with structured query parameters.
            3. Synthesize the spoken customer response strictly in {{user_language}} using natural conversational voice texture. Do not quote raw backend metadata verbatim.
        </action>
    </step>
</taskflow>
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Declared Tool Synchronization & Pre-Classification Ordering

1.  **Tool Declaration Synchronization**: Every `{@TOOL: tool_name}` referenced in instruction prompts MUST be declared in the agent's configuration `.json` under `"tools": ["tool_name"]`. Undeclared tools throw fatal `ToolNotFoundError` exceptions at runtime.
2.  **Pre-Classification Terminology Resolution**: When supporting localized product names, regional plan tiers, or specialized acronyms, invoke terminology resolution tools *before* intent classification or knowledge-base search to prevent misclassification.
3.  **Elimination of Deprecated Language-Switching Tools**: Deprecate dynamic language-switching tools (`language_switcher`, `en_to_es`). Session language is established at IVR/session initialization; dynamic tools add latency and risk hallucination.
